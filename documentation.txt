1) a text file. one query in each line
2) this file is read line by line and parsed into a list called queries
3) queries is converted itno queriesencoded
4) iterate over queriesencoded and fire a request. You receive 2 things - response status and response text which is a json object.
Add response status to csv. Parse the json response to extract confidence entity and value and add them to csv.
Finally, response text (json object) is appended in a separate file with every 2 consecutive json objects separated by a comma. This file is responsedump.txt. It will be used to store comma separated json responses as raw data dump of entire query set.
6) Convert responsedump.txt into responsedump.json. It already has comma separated json objects. Enclose everything in square brackets and you have an array. Add {"data":[ to the beginning of the fileand ]} at the end, and now you have a full fledged json object
with 1 key data which contains our response dump (array of json responses)


NOTE - dump.txt contains comma separated json resposne objects.
Remove the last comma from it.
Add {"data":[    in the beginning
Add ]} in the end

and this dump has now become a new json object that can be used further
